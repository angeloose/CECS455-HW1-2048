# CECS 455 Homework 1: 2048
___2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub.[2] The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS over a weekend, and released on 9 March 2014 as free and open-source software subject to the MIT License. Versions for iOS and Android followed in May 2014. ___ 
## Prerequisites
Python 3
Windows OS  (this code has been tested run only on Windows based systems)
**No pip installations necessary**

# To run code 
Open directory with 2048.py file path located.
In terminal run: *python 2048.py*

### Navigate menu and game using valid keyboard inputs: 
*  W    Play game
*  S    Input seed 
*  Q    Quit game

*  S    Move down
*  A    Move left
*  D    Move right
*  R    Restart game
*  Q    Quit game


## What I learned
I learned how to reduce code and functions through reusing the same move function for each direction. It is pretty interesting to see how developers
may get creativity when it comes to making games not just the core gameplay idea, but on how to save resources and computational power/memory. Learning
how to program 2048 definitely removes a bit of the magic from the game now that I know the ins and outs and that basically the tiles are kept as a 
double nested list. But creating games can be so simple that just using terminal is enough!
